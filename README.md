## Model Overview

- **Model**: YOLO11 (Ultralytics)
- **Purpose**: Detect structural defects in tyre cross-section images
- **Inference Strategy**: 
  - Vertically split image into `5`
  - Each part is further split into `12`
  - Each patch is independently analyzed by YOLO
  - Defect boxes are drawn and reassembled into final image
